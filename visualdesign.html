<h1 >Artifact #1</h1>
<img src="artifacts/camera shy.png" width="500" height="250" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist statement</h2>
	<p>I chose this album to redesign because it was my favorite artist at the time. It had all of my favorite songs. I used a picture and just kept making it dark till I liked the background.</p>
<h1>Artifact #2</h1>
	<img src="artifacts/potatoe head.png" width="500" height="350" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p>This is bartholomew the orange.He is pretty judgy but can be very friendly. 
	I made this by cutting out the background of the parts i wanted to use.Then i placed them together making Bartholomew come to life.</p>

<h1>Artifact #3</h1>
	<img src="artifacts/sammy the snowman.png" width="500" height="350" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
	<p>This is sammy the snowman.He is all bloody because he got into a fight with Frosty.FRost lost, obviously.
	I made this by creating Oval shapes and places them on top of eachother, the I used the pen tool to draw on the arms and face.</p>
<h1>Artifact #4</h1>
 <img src="artifacts/doodles.png" width="500" height="450" alt=""/>
<h2>Arist Statement</h2> 
	<p>In this project i used the pen tool to create the doodles.I also filled in with colors. I used circles to create the heads of the people, i made hearts and rectangles to make the dog. I made more of a collage than a story. They are set up like this because it kinda shows the two people and like the things around it like a heart, a dog, and a music disk. Its a little all over the place there isnâ€™t much of a story on it.
</p>
<h1>Artifact #5</h1>
	<img src="artifacts/dogs.png" width="500" height="400" alt=""/>
	
<h2>Artist statement </h2>
	<p> I did this by creating random lines using the tool pen. I added colors and little circles to make eyes. I turned it into little dogs. I used different shades of brown and gray because i feel like they were the most common color for small dogs.
</p>
<h1>Artifact #6</h1>
	<img src="artifacts/logos.png" width="500" height="450" alt=""/>
<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
<p>In this project I used the brush tool to make the logo.Then using the same tool i drew some books.I picked this to be my logo because i like to read.The mc is because of my last names i just put flipped them around.I also added some music notes because i like to listen to music.</p>
<h1>Artifact #7</h1>
<img src="artifacts/coat od arms.png" width="500" height="450" alt=""/>
	<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
	<p>For this I used a picture were it had both the Mexican and American flag because of where I am from. The CM is to represent my last name. The quote I used is from one of my favorite books. I like how it sounded and what is represented.</p>
