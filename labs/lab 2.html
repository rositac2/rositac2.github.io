<p class="text"> I think that i shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree
  <br>
A tree whose hungry mouth is pressed against the earths sweet flowing breast;
<br>
A tree that looks at God all day, and lifts her leafy arms to pray;
<br>
A tree that may in summer wear a nest of robbins in her hair;
<br>
A tree whose bossom snow has lain; who lives intimately with rain
<br>
Peoms are made by fools like me but only God can make a tree</p>
